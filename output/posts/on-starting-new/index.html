        <h1>On Starting New</h1>
<h2>Written for: Thu, 10 Mar 2011 06:02:54</h2>
<p>Many people have asked me, well...not really asked inasmuch as wondered why I would simply jump <a href="http://kcclaveria.com/2010/07/wordpress-vs-posterous-vs-tumblr/" target="_blank">publishing platforms</a> and start 100% new. Well to you good sir and doubtfully, mam, this guy has really no idea. It probably has something to do with a high probability that there is some "aydeeachdee" in them there genes, or maybe there was some unknown (but now known) monetary ponzie scheme that I have going on with my one reader. Maybe one reader? Anyway, the point of all this is to formally say that there won't be any importing of <a href="http://cloudbacon.posterous.com">my old material</a>. We started new, and dammit, we are going to finish new! With that, here is your tech moment of...catz5.</p>
