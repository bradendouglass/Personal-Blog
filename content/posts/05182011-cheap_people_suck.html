Being a proponent of expensive, yet long lasting items is often tough in a world where everything is built to be disposable. Rarely ever do you get to be apart of a conversation that focuses around "build quality" or obsolescence (a word that many Americans fear more than the end of American Idol). However, it is always refreshing when someone [pokes the bee's nest](http://www.ajkesslerblog.com/being-frugal-makes-you-a-loser/) and starts up a rather interesting conversation. 

The one thing that is problematic is his usage of the word "frugal." Frugal is a word that should be used to describe the "hacker-money-saver" not the person that buys loads of cheap shit. Aside from this, the post is spot on.
