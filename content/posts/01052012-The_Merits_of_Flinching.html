How many times during the day do you think that you flinch? Well, lets change that around a bit. How man times a day do you put yourself into a situation where you might flinch? We, as the inhabitants of the "[US](http://www.the-joke-box.com/pictures/tomahawk-utility-belt.jpg)" love security. Nice houses, confy jobs where we sit behind a computer and appear to be doing quality, work. What has all of this confort given us? Better health? [Nope](http://www.gohealthinsurance.com/blog-resources/american-health-care-info/), better retirement? [Definitely not](http://jobs.aol.com/articles/2011/12/15/most-employees-not-prepared-for-retirement-infographic/). What then?

Without experienceing situations that scare us how can we grow mentally and physically?

If, like our gag reflex, we could increase our abilities to withstand difficult situations, what would this world look like? What do you think? The book is free on amazon (kindle) and worth the 3 seconds it will take you to click on the buy now button. Seriously, go read it...if you [can](http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU)
