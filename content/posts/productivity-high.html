<a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/">Merlin Mann</a> is an absolute fucking force to be reckoned with. Not only is he, in my mind, one of the single most smart-assery people in the field of productivity, he is a genius with his <a href="http://twitter.com/hotdogsladies">humor</a>. He recently got together with the wonderful team behind <a href="http://macpowerusers.com/2011/03/mpu-046-workflows-with-merlin-mann-ii/">Mac Power Users Podcast</a> and produced an epic (2 1/2 hours) tome of meandering, shiny ramblings. This recording is a gem for anyone who is looking to be more efficient with their time, write like a crack addict, or just wants to learn something new.
