It's true, I have never really been much of a fan of the ancient productivity guru known as "Quicksilver". It was adopted by all my Mac loving brethren and even,
after several ad-hoc presentations, I continued to obstain. Launchbar was too small and Spotlight, if mastered couldn't come close to both the 3rd party
applications. In addition, everytime Quicksilver was left to rot due to an ambitious developer(s) realizing the size of the project, I was content knowing there
was no need to lament.

Recently the Quicksilver Project was [picked up](http://www.qsapp.com) by a group of very talented and driven developers who have a laundry list of grand plans
for the ailing product. With Quicksilver making a rapid comeback, I decided to drop my current productivity love affair: [Alfred](www.alfredapp.com) and give the
beast a whirl for the span of a long weekend(4-5 days).

**User Experience**  
Quicksilver still has one of the best looking UXs for its [time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksilver_\(software\)). It jumps into view with big
blocks that are easy to see and clearly show the user what they are doing at the very moment. Launchbar, with its tiny "unibar" easily fails hard in this
category. Quicksilver's simple select what you want to do(noun), tab over to select an action(verb), and if needed, a location approach to doing things is truly
brilliant! If a mistake is made, the user just tabs back to the problem, fixes it and goes about their merry way. Alfred and Launchbar both prescribe to a
"unibar" philosophy which can be confusing if the user forgets where they are in their launching process.

**Functionality**  
These applications construct a higher amount of functionality over Spotlight(OS X default), hence why many of us use them. Alfred isn't more
than a few years old which means 99% of its functionality works great on a new, Intel powered, Lion running Mac. Lock, Shutdown, and other system commands
function beautifully (NOT true with Quicksilver) along with the clipboard, file navigation, etc. Quicksilver continues to be burdened with the cruft from its days
being build on and for the PPC architecture and man, does it show:

1. The app doesn't run in 64bit mode 
1. Many of the plugins haven't been updated in 4+ years (they are working on it) 
1. Several of the apps rely on the PPC architecture which isn't supported in Snow Leopard or Lion (SL was released in August 2009) 
1. The app itself continues to be flaky with several crashes per day under heavy use

**Extensibility**  
Quicksilver is known for having an incredibly robust plugin structure that extends the base for a plethora of different user types. 1Password,
Bbedit, Vim, Photos, FlickrUploads, and etc are just a few that are at the user's fingertip. As a self proclaimed "power-user" this excites me. However, several
weeks ago Alfred implemented the ability to run applescripts, shell scripts, and automator workflows. Although Qucksilver has a leg up with the raw amount of
extensions, many of them need updating because of their age. I am genuinly excited to see what kind of plugins are developed by Alfred's robust and seeminly
clever community. Here are just a few so far: [Alfred Extensions](http://blog.alfredapp.com/2011/08/02/alfred-extensions/)

**Conclusions**  
At the end of the weekend I simply couldn't wait to fire back up Alfred and get back to work. Sure there is always a problem of knowing how to
access similar functions in new applications, however; this wasn't specific to my case. I spent a good portion of time tweaking and "groking" the Quicksilver way
(a good 2-5 hours). However, was ultimately unimpressed with its high crash rate (running on a 1st gen 17inch(2.66C2D/8gigs) Unibody w/ SSD + Optibay),
inconsistent plugin compatibility, and the amount of time it took to rescan for new items(fairly sure Quicksilver continues to use its own index, not
Spotlight's). For the immediate future, this nerd is sticking with Alfred. In addition, I have a powerpack licences for Alfred so if you [don't feel like
assisting really cool developers](https://www.facebook.com/wiltj), yet want some of the functionality mentioned above, stick with Quicksilver as a free solution.
