...<del>worst</del> best. Well nursing a food comma from lunch this afternoon, I stumbled onto <a href="http://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2011/03/18/professionalism-is-for-amateurs/" target="_blank">this post about "professionalism"</a> from the editor / owner of <a href="http://thenextweb.com/" target="_blank">The Next Web</a>. The epidemic issue underlying the idea of professionalism is the fact that people hide behind it. They might initially think it is the correct way to act in a business situation; however, as they evolve it becomes a shield and eventually a crutch. I implore everyone to read the article, it is quick, easy and written oh so much better than what I could produce. Afterward, think long and hard why you may weight the idea of professionalism so highly.
