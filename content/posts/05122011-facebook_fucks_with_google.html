USA Today...today brought forth a story of well, borific preportions. The wonderful and apparently always sane PR team at Facebook thought that it would be smart to pitch anti-Google stories to online newspapers and blogs. The problem was, one of those bloggers didn't feel like going along with the whole idea. A few emails later and everyone knows a major player in the tech industry is hating on Google. Eventually, dealing with mounting evidence, Facebook issued a statement claiming it was their cockup.

Blogs began picking up the story and before anyone knew it, it was everywhere. The issue is...who cares? So Facebook happens to hire a PR firm to slander Google, maybe a little competition is a good thing. Then again, I played rugby for several years and playing dirty is the only way that game is fun. Facebook was in the wrong, they got caught, snoring really. Bring on the cooler shit!
