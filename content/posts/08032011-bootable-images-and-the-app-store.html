Anyone worth their Mac loving salt knows how hardware agnostic the OS is. Need to send your main computer in for repair because of a faulty batch of harddrives but, not want to be out a machine
for a couple of important days? A bootable image is a "snapshot" of everything that is going on at the [block level](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_\(data_storage\)) of your OS. In most cases, these images are captured using a firewire drive
(hopefully soon to be Thunderbold drive) and can be used to run any other piece of Apple hardware(computers, not iPads). Well sort of.

PPC architecture images can ONLY be booted with PPC Macs and the same goes for Intel. In addition, a Lion image won't even boot on an old coreDuo machine (anyone seen a workaround?). Downtime
is reduced to nothing with this method...or usually. For some reason, several of the apps that were purchased from the App Store, annoy the user on startup for a username and password. However 
when entered, the app simply dissapears. Wonder if anyone else is seeing odd behavior like this?

Seeing how this blog doesn't support a comment system, I have decided to find something that DOES...in the near future. For now, check out [this thread](https://plus.google.com/110242821851159208531/posts/RJSpAQJvstp) on Google+ and drop your comment(s).
